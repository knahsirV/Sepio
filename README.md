# Sepio

# Inspiration
This creative prompt allowed us to look outside of the box when finding a solution. We realized that all of us were fascinated by the development of the Roman Empire. We were intrigued by how well it was able to grow, and wondered what would happen if it continued to do so. After researching, we found that the empire slowly died because they were unable to effectively govern all parts of the empire, causing it to grow thin because of its sheer size. As a result, we created this application using present day technologies, which we believe, could have helped Roman generals immensely during the process.

# What it does
The website is connected to motion sensor cameras that can detect incoming individuals and their logos. These logos will then be cross-referenced with the pre-existing database of logos indicating whether the logo is associated with an ally or enemy. If it is associated with an enemy or if the logo isn’t registered, then local troops will be alerted. The website will also include statistics on how many weapons there are in barracks. It will also include information on empire borders so villagers know what areas are safe within borders.

# How We built it
The webapp was designed in Angular, using the Node javascript extension. Multiple APIs, such as the Google Maps API were implemented. The biggest challenges while designing were getting a user login system, getting an interactive map, and linking to 3d models. To build the 3d models, the echoAR API was used. From here, live models were linked as buttons on the webapp. As for actual course information, research had to be conducted into fire safety, lab safety, tornado safety, and more. It did help that all of us are currently students, since we already know most of the safety procedures. Ultimately, the development of the webapp relied on Angular and countless APIs for the amazing features we have implemented.

# Challenges We ran into
Throughout the process, we had a difficult time trying to identify the most effective implementation of the camera AI system. It was difficult to get the API to allow this to work on the website itself, which used the webcams for feed information.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the fact that we made an app that perfectly aligns with what the Romans needed. The Romans fell apart because the empire was too large to maintain. With this app, they could’ve easily had a handle on many various aspects of the empire and make sure troops were ready to fight. They could also send weapons to locations that are lacking those unnecessary resources.

# What We learned
Throughout this hackathon experience, we were able to learn about cool tools and technologies to help support this application with all of its features. We learned how to effectively pitch an idea, by incorporating personal experiences and detailed flowcharts to explain our thinking. On the technical side, we explored the possibilities of AR, surprised by the intuitive and effective echoAR tool, which enabled us to better support the courses. Finally, the execution of the webapp was a super cool learning process. We learned how to incorporate a Google Maps API into our webapp to allow for user interaction on our case map.

# What's next for Sepio
We’ve seen how influential a product like Saepio For the Roman Empire. In times where land dominance means power, the Romans would have benefited immensely from this application. But if you look into it, this technology can also be implemented in the modern world to help improve our lives too! For example, this same AI algorithm can be used for homeowners with cameras on their front door, which can scan symbols on packages for categorization. The AR of the inventory can also be applied to personal home collections of coins or weapons. Finally, it can be used by property owners to manage their property
